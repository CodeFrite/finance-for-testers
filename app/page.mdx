# Finance for Testers

In this blog, we will explore the world of finance from a tester's perspective. More specifically, we will focus on two main areas of finance: Trading and Settlements for Thirds.

Once we have a good understanding of these two areas, we will focus on how you will, as a tester, be able to test the different components of these two domains.

The general glossary will help you understand the terms and concepts used in finance. We will also provide a list of resources for further reading and learning.

Please keep in mind that depending on the market you are operating in, the chain of actors and the processes may slightly differ without major impact on the core concepts. Therefore, we will first make sure to explain the concepts in a general way and then we will see how they are applied on specific markets.

Now, buckle up and get ready for a ride into the world of finance!
